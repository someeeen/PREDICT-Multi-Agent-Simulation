# Faiss Embedding Database

This folder does not contain pre-generated Faiss embedding database files.
Faiss is a library for high-dimensional vector search, and the embedding database needs to be created based on the user's specific data.

## How to Create the Database

1. **Prepare Data:**
   - Prepare the data to be embedded, such as text data or image feature vectors.
   - Perform any necessary preprocessing (normalization, tokenization, etc.).
   - Ensure your data is in a file format such as `.npy`, `.txt`, or `.csv`.

2. **Choose an Embedding Model:**
   - Select the embedding model you want to use.
   - Embed your data using the chosen model.
     - This can be done using Python code (see example code).

3. **Create a Faiss Database:**
   - Create a Faiss index using the embedded vectors.
   - Choose the appropriate index type as needed.
     - This can be done using Python code (see example code).

4. **Save the Database:**
   - Save the generated Faiss index to a file.
     - It is common to save it with the `.index` extension.

## Example Code (Python)

The following is an example code for embedding and creating a Faiss database. (This code is a general example and may need to be modified for your specific environment.)

```python
import numpy as np
import faiss
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# 1. Load Embedding Model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')  # Example: Sentence-BERT model

# 2. Load Data and Embed (Example: Text Data)
texts = [
    "This is the first sentence.",
    "Here is the second sentence.",
    "The third sentence comes now.",
    "And this is the last one."
]
embeddings = model.encode(texts)  # (4, 768) shape

# 3. Create Faiss Index
d = embeddings.shape[1]  # Embedding dimension
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)   # Example: Using IndexFlatL2 index
index.add(embeddings)

# 4. Save the Index
faiss.write_index(index, "my_faiss_index.index")

print("Faiss index saved successfully.")
